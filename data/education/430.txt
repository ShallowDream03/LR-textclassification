To the foreign visitor, Americans seem to be more concerned withgetting things accomplished on time (according to a predetermined schedule)than they are with developing deep interpersonal relations. Schedules, for theAmerican, are meant to be planned and then followed in the smallest detail。 It may seem to you that mostAmericans are completely controlled by the little machines they wear on theirwrists, cutting their discussions off abruptly to make it to their nextappointment on time。 Americans’ language is filled withreferences to time, giving a clear indication of how much it is valued. Time issomething to be “on,”to be “kept,” “filled,” “saved,” “wasted,” “gained,” “planned,” “given,” “made the most of,” even “killed。” The international visitor soonlearns that it’s considered very rude to be late -- even by 10 minutes -- foran appointment in America。 Time is so valued in America,because by considering time to be important one can clearly achieve more thanif one “wastes” time and doesn’t keep busy. This philosophyhas proven its worth. It has enabled Americans to be extremely productive, andproductivity itself is highly valued in America. Many American proverbsstress the value of guarding time, using it wisely, and setting and workingtowards specific goals. Americans believe in spending their time and energytoday so that the fruits of their labor may be enjoyed at a later time。 2012年12月英语四级考后难度调查 2012年12月英语六级考后难度调查
